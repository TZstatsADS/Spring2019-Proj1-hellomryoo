### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Boys and Girls! Single and Married! Are You Happy?! 
+ This project is conducted by HyunBin Yoo

+ Project summary: In this project, I would like to define the distiction between what defines "Happiness" among different genders and marital status. This would be a crutial database which could be used as a cornerstone of development of any dating application such as Tinder and eharmony. I have used statistical analysis tool such as proportion graph, wordcloud, and topic modeling.
