### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Boys and Girls! Single and Married! Are You Happy?! 
+ This project is conducted by HyunBin Yoo

+ Project summary: In this project, I would like to define the distiction between what defines "Happiness" among different genders and marital status. This would be a crutial database which could be used as a cornerstone of development of any dating application such as Tinder and eharmony. I have used statistical analysis tool such as proportion graph, wordcloud, and topic modeling. We were able to conduct analysis on how male and female see in their happy moment and also on how single and married people see in their happy momemt. 


Following [suggestions](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) by [RICH FITZJOHN](http://nicercode.github.io/about/#Team) (@richfitz). This folder is orgarnized as follows.

+ Reference: I have used the following website to learn about how to code topic modeling in R: https://rpubs.com/cosmopolitanvan/topicmodeling 

+ Thing to note: my html was generated by commenting out all R codes. Since I am using Shiny app, I wasn't able to put together it into html. To reproduce the analysis itself, please run each R codes by chunk (each chunk separately). You may you HM.Rdata for easier reproduction.
